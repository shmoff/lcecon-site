        The economics course is designed to test your knowledge of economic events and issues. Being able to cite statistics and experts is a central part of the research study. 
        For the written course, questions often reference the performance of the Irish economy. You may also be given charts, tables or quotes and asked to describe or explain them.
        So having up to date information on areas like employment, national income, inflation, etc going into the exam, will really improve the quality of your answers.
